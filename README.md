## Binary Search

 In this program, the user creates an array and can search for an element in it. The user first starts by entering the size of the array n, and 0<n<128. 
 
After that the user writes each element of the array in a loop, 0<arr[i]<128. 

If the user tries to enter a non-number character, or a number outside the specified range, in either the array size or in an entry, the program will terminate with an error message.
