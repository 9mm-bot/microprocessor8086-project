## Encryption & Decryption Algorithm
This simple encryption program is made for the 8086 microprocessor. In the mono-numeric substitution encryption, each alphabetic letter is substituted by a number according to the following table:

  | Plain Text |   Cipher Text    |
  |:----------:|:----------------:|
  |    a       |        26        | 
  |    b       |        25        |
  |    c       |        24        |
  |    d       |        23        |
  |    e       |        22        |
  |    f       |        21        |
  |    g       |        20        |
  |    h       |        19        | 
  |    i       |        18        |
  |    j       |        17        | 
  |    k       |        16        | 
  |    l       |        15        | 
  |    m       |        14        | 
  |    n       |        13        |
  |    o       |        12        |
  |    p       |        11        |
  |    q       |        10        | 
  |    r       |        9         | 
  |    s       |        8         |
  |    t       |        7         |
  |    u       |        6         |
  |    v       |        5         |
  |    w       |        4         |
  |    x       |        3         |
  |    y       |        2         |
  |    z       |        1         |
  
  ## Steps
   1- Constructing the table and storing it in the memory. <br>
   2- Writing a program to encrypt the input message.<br>
   3- Decrypting the cipher text to obtain the original text message.
