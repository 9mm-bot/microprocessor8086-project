## Binary Search

 In this program, the user creates an array and can search for an element in it. The user first starts by entering the size of the array n, and 0<n<128. 
 
After that the user writes each element of the array in a loop, 0<arr[i]<128. 

If the user tries to enter a non-number character, or a number outside the specified range, in either the array size or in an entry, the program will terminate with an error message. 

For the searching technique to work, the array needs to be sorted, with the order of elements going from smallest to largest. So for example if the user enters '5' in the first element, the following element has to be greater than or equal to 5, and if he tried to enter something like '2' or '3', the program gives an error message, then restarts the current step in the loop.
